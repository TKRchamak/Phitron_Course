Day 2:
    -> JOIN table
    -> JOIN statement --> ON, USING
    -> INNER JOIN
    -> OUTER JOIN
    -> LEFT JOIN
    -> RIGHT JOIN
    -> FULL JOIN
=============================================================

What is JOIN ?
--> it s use for Join 2 or more table, its more efficient and faster.

==> SELECT data from multiple table without JOIN table
    *** disadvantage of this is time consuming // huge loop

        -> SELECT student.roll, student.name, result.grade
           FROM student, result
           WHERE student.roll = result.roll;

JOIN syntax:
        -> SELECT field_names
           FROM table1 JOIN table2 USING (field_name)
           WHERE
           GROUP BY
           HAVING
           ORDER BY

    JOIN USING:
        SELECT employees.employee_id, employees.first_name, departments.department_name
        FROM employees JOIN departments USING (department_id);

    JOIN ON:
        SELECT employees.employee_id, employees.first_name, departments.department_name
        FROM employees JOIN departments ON(employees.department_id == departments.department_id);

SELF join:
    *** self join er somoy USING use kora jabe na.
    nijet table er songe nijer join.

    employee is employee, 
    manager is also an employee,

    if find employee name and the employee's manager name than need to self join.

INNER join: 
    *** if find or select only common thing from 2 or more then 2 table, than need inner join.
        --> SELECT *
            FROM order
            INNER customer
            ON (order.customer_id, customer.customer_id)


LEFT join:
    select all left table data and from right table select only fullfil condition data
        --> SELECT *
            FROM order
            LEFT customer
            ON (order.customer_id, customer.customer_id)



RIGHT join:
    select all right table data and from left table select only fullfil condition data
        --> SELECT *
            FROM order
            RIGHT customer
            ON (order.customer_id, customer.customer_id)

FULL join:
    select all data from left and right table and set null  in empty field.
        --> SELECT *
            FROM order
            FULL customer
            ON (order.customer_id, customer.customer_id)
