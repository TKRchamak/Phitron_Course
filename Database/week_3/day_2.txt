Day 2:
    -> JOIN table
    -> JOIN statement --> ON, USING
    -> INNER JOIN
    -> OUTER JOIN
    -> LEFT JOIN
    -> RIGHT JOIN
=============================================================

What is JOIN ?
--> it s use for Join 2 or more table, its more efficient and faster.

==> SELECT data from multiple table without JOIN table
*** disadvantage of this is time consuming // huge loop

        -> SELECT student.roll, student.name, result.grade
           FROM student, result
           WHERE student.roll = result.roll;

JOIN syntax:
        -> SELECT field_names
           FROM table1 JOIN table2 USING (field_name)
           WHERE
           GROUP BY
           HAVING
           ORDER BY

    JOIN USING:
        SELECT employees.employee_id, employees.first_name, departments.department_name
        FROM employees JOIN departments USING (department_id);

    JOIN ON:
