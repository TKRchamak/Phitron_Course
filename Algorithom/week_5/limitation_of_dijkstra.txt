Dijkstra shortcomings:
    --> it can not work with negative value properly / all-time,
    --> can not detect negative cycle
    --> it work with DAG(directed acyclic graph)

           5          1
    1 --------- 2 -------- 4
     \         /
  -10 \       / 2
       \     /
          3

this graph have Negative Cycle & Negative Edge,

For this negative cycle, after relaxation the final node value is almost negative infinity
