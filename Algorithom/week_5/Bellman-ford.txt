edges for this graph : the graph is directed

For this graph find SSSP distance need maximum(n-1) iteration if there n nodes.-----> this is the Bellman-Ford algo.


// Pseudo code : Bellman-Ford

Input  -> A weighted, directed graph( with no negative cycle), a source node.
Output -> Shorted distance from src node to all other nodes

- create a distance value "d" with all value to infinity.
- d[src] = 0;
- for i=1 to n-1:   -> O(n)
    - for all edge e(u, v, w)   -> O(E * V)
        - if d[u]+ w < d[v]:
            -> d[v] = d[u] + W

- print the distance array "d"


time complexity ------>  O( |V| * |E| ) = O(n * n^2) = O(n^3)

*** time complexity is the draw back for Bellman-Ford
